- Design and write your code so it isn't measurably quicker or slower when errors occur, even if this means performing redundant computations.
- Use a stream cipher, not a block cipher, to avoid the need for plaintext padding.
- Checksum the data after encryption, rather than encrypting the checksum. This ensures that the quantity of data to be checksummed does not depend on the plaintext.
- Use an authenticated encryption algorithm, like AES-GCM, that combines checksumming and ciphering.
